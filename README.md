# ETL-PIPELINE-API
This project builds an ETL pipeline using Python and SQL. It extracts data from the CoinGecko API, cleans and transforms it (handling missing values and duplicates), and loads the data into a Microsoft SQL Server database. The process is automated using a batch file scheduled with Windows Task Scheduler.
